# Event Management System – Mid-Term Project

This project is a mid-term **Business Application Project** submission by [@Muhammad Ahmad Amin](https://github.com/MAhmadAmin) for the **Database Systems** course *(2nd Semester, BS Computer Science)*, instructed by Prof. Nazeef ul Haq at **UET (University of Engineering & Technology) Lahore**.

The backend is driven primarily by a well-designed relational database — showcasing normalization, transactions, and integrity — while selectively implementing OOP principles to keep the codebase clean and modular, embodying the core lessons from courses."



## Learning Objectives

- Design and implement a **normalized relational database** using MySQL 
- Apply pure OOP concepts such as **four pillars OOP**, **Design Patterns** & **SOLID Principles** in a real system  
- Understand how **backend logic and database structure** work together in a business application  
- Bridge academic learning with practical application through a complete working project
- Apply Database concepts such as **normalization**, **referential integrity**, and **transactions**.
