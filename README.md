The Information Technology Exhibition and Competition (ITEC) is an annual event organized 
by the Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore. The event includes various activities 
such as competitions, exhibitions, seminars, and non-tech events. It is managed by faculty 
members and students, with responsibilities distributed across multiple organizing committees.

This project is purposed to streamline event management; as it provides a centralized Event Management System to 
digitize and automate the entire process.

This is a desktop-based Windows Form Application using C# and MySQL, developed to 
streamline event planning, participant management, committee roles, financial tracking, and 
duty assignments.
